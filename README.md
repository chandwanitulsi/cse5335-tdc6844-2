Sample application to display a list of restaurants
==========================================================================

Server Framework
-----------------
This application uses Node.js for its server framework.


Client Framework
----------------
This application uses angular.js for client side scripting

Database
----------------
This application uses mongoDB as its database


What aspect of the implementation did you find easy if any and why?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It was easy to create a mongodb instance on local system and query mongodb with easy functions and connecting mongo with node using mongoose.

What aspect of the implementation did you find hard if any and why?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Creating an instance of mLab and how to connect it with my app , options were confusing in first but I got the way to connect mLab witha app, connecting mLab with mongo shell and uploading the data on server.Sometimes the code was working on heroku and sometimes it was giving error due to internet connection.

If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proper Connectivity of heroku with mLab.
Bofore using it profesionally i would try to learn how to use angular and mongoose in a better way n have greater knowledge of MEAn Stack.
